# AI from mathematical principles
This repo contains is dedicated to my own self-learning of AI. Specifically, I wish to codify my learning process for future reference. I find that intuition on these topics is best developed through an understanding of their mathematical foundations. I'm not the best at LaTeX, so say what you will about the code itself; the math is solid.
